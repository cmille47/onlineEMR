4/24 fun!:
adjusted layout of dashboard. Centered button
Side by side card elements. May need to add something below? Maybe like a tutorial/text section telling them how to use it?

Went to patient chart and began changing inner components to editable fields. Need to implement a save button probably. Huh. For the complaints and such we can make fill in fields similar to the dashboard that can make a request and create a dropdown of most used complaints/medications/etc based off what is already in the database. Autofilling feature would be really cool.

Only got cheif complaint/diagonosis done
